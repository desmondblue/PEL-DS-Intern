Algorithm:
In the attempts collection. Count number of attempts made by the student for a particular test(total questions either 20 or 45).
Then take the mean of the total marks for all the attempts.
Repeat the process for all the students for the same test that is either for 20 question test or 45 question test.
Once we get the data.
We can sort the mean marks of students in descending orders based on number of attempts.
If the correlation between marks and number of attempts comes out to be high and positive in most of the cases it will imply that the statement stands true.
