Question:
Does more practice mean better performance?

Breakdown:
As per my understanding. I think the solution to this problem will be.
Improving trends in grades with the increase in attempts by the students.

Hence if a student has scored less in earlier attempts and then in further attempts his or her grades are improving. 
Therefore if this trend is seen for a group of students it will justify the statement "more practice means better performance".
Which will imply that if a student is scoring less he or she needs to practise more.
Otherwise if the trend of "improving scores for increasing attempts" is not seen for a group of students.
The problem statement will be negated and thus "more practice is not equal to better performance".
